## Usage

To add addresses support to your eloquent models simply use `\Awalhadi\Addressable\Traits\Addressable` trait.

### Manage your addresses

```php
// Get instance of your model
$user = new \App\Models\User::find(1);

// Create a new address
$user->addresses()->create([
    'label' => 'Default Address',
    'given_name' => 'Abdelrahman',
    'family_name' => 'Omran',
    'organization' => 'Rinvex',
    'country_code' => 'eg',
    'street' => '56 john doe st.',
    'state' => 'Alexandria',
    'city' => 'Alexandria',
    'postal_code' => '21614',
    'lat' => '31.2467601',
    'lng' => '29.9020376',
    'is_primary' => true,
    'is_billing' => true,
    'is_shipping' => true,
]);

// Create multiple new addresses
$user->addresses()->createMany([
    [...],
    [...],
    [...],
]);

// // Find an existing address
// $address = app('rinvex.addresses.address')->find(1);

// // Update an existing address
// $address->update([
//     'label' => 'Default Work Address',
// ]);

// // Delete address
// $address->delete();

// Alternative way of address deletion
$user->addresses()->where('id', 123)->first()->delete();
```

### Manage your addressable model

The API is intuitive and very straight forward, so let's give it a quick look:

```php
// Get instance of your model
$user = new \App\Models\User::find(1);

// Get attached addresses collection
$user->addresses;

// Get attached addresses query builder
$user->addresses();

// // Scope Primary Addresses
// $primaryAddresses = app('rinvex.addresses.address')->isPrimary()->get();

// // Scope Billing Addresses
// $billingAddresses = app('rinvex.addresses.address')->isBilling()->get();

// // Scope Shipping Addresses
// $shippingAddresses = app('rinvex.addresses.address')->isShipping()->get();

// // Scope Addresses in the given country
// $egyptianAddresses = app('rinvex.addresses.address')->InCountry('eg')->get();

// Find all users within 5 kilometers radius from the lat/lng 31.2467601/29.9020376
$fiveKmAddresses = \App\Models\User::findByDistance(5, 'kilometers', '31.2467601', '29.9020376')->get();

// Alternative method to find users within certain radius
$user = new \App\Models\User();
$users = $user->lat('31.2467601')->lng('29.9020376')->within(5, 'kilometers')->get();
```
