### Step 3: Create Git Tag

```bash
# Create annotated tag
git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Version 2.0.0 - Complete Package Modernization"

# Push tag to remote
git push origin v2.0.0
```

### Step 4: Publish to Packagist

#### Option A: Automatic Publishing (Recommended)

If you have GitHub integration set up with Packagist:

1. The package will be automatically published when you push the tag
2. Check Packagist dashboard to confirm the new version is available

#### Option B: Manual Publishing

```bash
# Create distribution archive
composer archive --format=zip --dir=dist

# Or publish directly (if you have Packagist credentials)
composer publish
```

### Step 5: Verify Publication

1. **Check Packagist**: Visit https://packagist.org/packages/awalhadi/addressable
2. **Verify Version**: Ensure 2.0.0 is listed as the latest version
3. **Test Installation**: Try installing in a fresh Laravel project
4. **Check Downloads**: Monitor download statistics
